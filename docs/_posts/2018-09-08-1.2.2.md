- Changed the way to access multiple daemon configurations.
You can now send requests to different daemons with `omnitools()->client($name)` call. (e. g. `omnitools()->client('litecoin')->getBlock('...')`)
(see [Configuration](https://github.com/denpamusic/laravel-bitcoinrpc#configuration) and [Multiple Instances](https://github.com/denpamusic/laravel-bitcoinrpc#multiple-instances) for more info)
- Removed unused facade
